# SDR Lab Setup  
A VM has been provided for the lab [here](), but if you'd like to configure this on a different system you have two options:  
* Pull down `Kickstart.sh` and run it on an Ubuntu 14.04 machine  
* If you are running on a Debian-based system, pull down `Kickstart.sh` and `Debian_Setup.sh`, then either modify the OS checks to allow for your OS or remove the OS checks altogether.  If the scripts are successful, either open an issue or pull request to let me know of your testing and I will modify the OS support in the scripts.
