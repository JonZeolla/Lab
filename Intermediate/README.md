# Password cracking - Intermediate  

There are no hints for the Intermediate lab, you'll have to do this on your own...  Fall back to the Beginner lab if necessary.  

## Step 0
1. Clone the Password Cracking branch by running the following command.
  * If you haven't created an account, go to https://github.com/join.
```
mkdir SCIS_Password_Lab ; cd SCIS_Password_Lab ; git clone -b PasswordCracking --single-branch https://github.com/JonZeolla/Lab ; cd Lab
```

## Step 1  
* Install whichever files you think will help most from [Intermediate/Downloads](https://github.com/JonZeolla/Lab/tree/PasswordCracking/Intermediate/Downloads).  Because you cloned the repo in Step 0, you now have the appropriate installers locally under SCIS_Password_Lab/Lab/.Storage, but the README under [Intermediate/Downloads](https://github.com/JonZeolla/Lab/tree/PasswordCracking/Intermediate/Downloads) may help point you at the exact file (Best viewed in a web browser).  Password lists are located under SCIS_Password_Lab/Lab/.Storage/Lists locally.  If you see tools that you haven't used before, feel free to play around and ask questions.  

## Step 2  
* Crack the two [Intermediate Password Dumps](https://github.com/JonZeolla/Lab/tree/PasswordCracking/Intermediate/Password_Dumps), also located locally under SCIS_Password_Lab/Lab/Intermediate/Password_Dumps as fast and thoroughly as possible.  

## Step 3  
Improve on your cracking speeds by auditing the results of Step 2.  

### All OSs  
1.  Run [PassPal.rb](https://github.com/JonZeolla/Lab/blob/PasswordCracking/.Storage/passpal.rb) which can be used to speed up the time it takes to crack the dump and better understand the data.  

Good luck!
