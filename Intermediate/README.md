# Password cracking - Intermediate

There are no hints for the Intermediate lab, you'll have to do this on your own...  Fall back to the Beginner lab if necessary.  

## Step 0  
* Clone the Password Cracking branch by replacing the _<Username>_ with your GitHub username in the following command.  If you haven't created an account, go to [https://github.com/join].
```
mkdir SCIS_Password_Lab && cd SCIS_Password_Lab && git clone -b Password-Cracking_2015-09-24 --single-branch https://_<Username>_@github.com/JonZeolla/Presentation_Materials && cd Presentation_Materials
```

### Step 1  
* Install whichever files you think will help most from [Intermediate/Downloads](https://github.com/JonZeolla/Presentation_Materials/tree/Password-Cracking_2015-09-24/Intermediate/Downloads).  Because you cloned the repo in Step 0, you now have the appropriate installers locally under SCIS_Password_Lab/Presentation_Materials/.Storage, but the README under Intermediate/Downloads may help point you at the exact file.  If you see tools that you haven't used before, feel free to play around and ask questions.  

## Step 2  
* Crack the [Intermediate Password Dumps](https://github.com/JonZeolla/Presentation_Materials/tree/Password-Cracking_2015-09-24/Intermediate/Password_Dumps) located under SCIS_Password_Lab/Presentation_Materials/Intermediate/Password_Dumps as fast and thoroughly as possible.  

Good luck!
