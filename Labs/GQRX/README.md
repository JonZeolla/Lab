# gqrx  
gqrx is the gnu radio spectrum analyzer.  
  
1. Connect your RTL-SDR dongle and antenna.  
2. In a terminal, run 'gqrx'.  
3. Press the on/off button in the upper left to start the DSP visualization.  

If you are having issues, you can try to use the `TuneIn.sh` script in the current directory.  If you'd like an example capture of a Multicode garage door opener run `cat xa? >> FM_889_2M.raw` in this directory, however, if you use the setup script or the OVA, this should already be done for you.
