# Presentation Materials  
## Actually read this  
This is the repo where I host branches which have materials that I use in presentations, labs, etc.  
The reason I do this is so that you do not need to download all of the labs just to get the one that you're interested in.  Some labs are rather large, or may be presented in locations where throughput is low.  
  
In order to use this repo as intended, you MUST switch to the appropriate branch, via the web UI or CLI.  See `git branch -r` to list these via the command line, or the dropdown directly to the left of the `New pull request` button.  
  
Example:  
* `git clone -b Software-Defined-Radios_2016-02-11 --single-branch https://github.com/JonZeolla/Presentation_Materials`
