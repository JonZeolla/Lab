# Password cracking - Competition

## Step 0
* Install whichever tools you feel are appropriate.  Some reference tools are available at the [Competition/Downloads](https://github.com/JonZeolla/Presentation_Materials/tree/master/2015-09-24_SteelCityInfoSec_Password-Cracking/Competition/Downloads) section of my GitHub.  

## Step 1
* Download the Password Dump files from the [Competition/Password_Dumps](https://github.com/JonZeolla/Presentation_Materials/tree/master/2015-09-24_SteelCityInfoSec_Password-Cracking/Competition/Password_Dumps) section of my GitHub.  

## Step 2
* Crack 80%+ of the password dump provided as fast as possible.  

## Step 3
* Submit screenshots/proof as a git pull request under [Competition/Results](https://github.com/JonZeolla/Presentation_Materials/tree/master/2015-09-24_SteelCityInfoSec_Password-Cracking/Competition/Results).  Rewards will be given for the fastest time to break the first 80%, and for the largest % of the dump getting cracked.  In the case that 100% of the dump gets cracked, the first person to submit proof wins.  

Good luck!
