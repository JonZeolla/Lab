# Password cracking - Competition

## Step 0  
* Clone the Password Cracking branch by replacing the _<Username>_ with your GitHub username in the following command.  If you haven't created an account, go to https://github.com/join.  Competing requires that you have a GitHub account (see step 4).  
```
mkdir SCIS_Password_Lab && cd SCIS_Password_Lab && git clone -b Password-Cracking_2015-09-24 --single-branch https://_<Username>_@github.com/JonZeolla/Presentation_Materials && cd Presentation_Materials
```

### Step 1  
* Install whichever files you think will help most from [Competition/Downloads](https://github.com/JonZeolla/Presentation_Materials/tree/Password-Cracking_2015-09-24/Competition/Downloads).  Because you cloned the repo in Step 0, you now have the appropriate installers locally under SCIS_Password_Lab/Presentation_Materials/.Storage, but the README under Competition/Downloads may help point you at the exact file.  

## Step 2  
* Crack the [Competition Password Dumps](https://github.com/JonZeolla/Presentation_Materials/tree/Password-Cracking_2015-09-24/Competition/Password_Dumps) located locally under SCIS_Password_Lab/Presentation_Materials/Competition/Password_Dumps as fast and thoroughly as possible.  

## Step 3  
* Crack 80%+ of the password dump provided as fast as possible.  

## Step 4  
* Submit screenshots/proof as a git pull request under [Competition/Results](https://github.com/JonZeolla/Presentation_Materials/tree/Password-Cracking_2015-09-24/Competition/Results).  Rewards will be given for the shortest amount of time to break 80% of the passwords, and a second reward for the person who cracks the largest % of the dump.  In the case that 100% of the dump gets cracked, the first person to submit proof wins.  
  * Details on how to submit a git pull are located at https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/  

Good luck!
