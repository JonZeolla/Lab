# Password cracking - Competition  

## Step 0
1. Clone the Password Cracking branch by running the following command.
  * If you haven't created an account, go to https://github.com/join.
```
mkdir SCIS_Password_Lab ; cd SCIS_Password_Lab ; git clone -b PasswordCracking --single-branch https://github.com/JonZeolla/Lab ; cd Lab
```

## Step 1  
* Install whichever files you think will help most from [Competition/Downloads](https://github.com/JonZeolla/Lab/tree/PasswordCracking/Competition/Downloads).  Because you cloned the repo in Step 0, you now have the appropriate installers locally under SCIS_Password_Lab/Lab/.Storage, but the README under Competition/Downloads may help point you at the exact file.  Password lists are located under SCIS_Password_Lab/Lab/.Storage/Lists locally.  

## Step 2  
* Crack the [Competition Password Dump](https://github.com/JonZeolla/Lab/tree/PasswordCracking/Competition/Password_Dumps), also located locally under SCIS_Password_Lab/Lab/Competition/Password_Dumps, as fast and thoroughly as possible.  

## Step 3  
* Work to crack 80%+ of the password dump provided as fast as possible.  

## Step 4  
* Submit screenshots/proof as a git pull request under [Competition/Results](https://github.com/JonZeolla/Lab/tree/PasswordCracking/Competition/Results).  Rewards will be given for the shortest amount of time to break 80% of the passwords, and a second reward for the person who cracks the largest % of the dump.  In the case that 100% of the dump gets cracked, the first person to submit proof wins.  
  * Details on how to submit a git pull are located at https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/  
  * The competition is officially over  

Good luck!
