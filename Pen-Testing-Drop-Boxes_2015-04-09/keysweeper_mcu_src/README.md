Keyboard locking issue: https://www.youtube.com/all_comments?v=WqkmGG0biXc
`if (p[4] == 0xCD)` to `if (1)`

"each keyboard seems to only use 4 frequencies in one of these sets: {3, 19, 78, 78}, {29, 50, 70, 80}, {21, 31, 72, 54}, {5, 25, 44, 52}, {23, 46, 56, 74}, {17, 27, 48, 76}"


-- Uploading code to the pro mini --

If you're using the "ADAFRUIT INDUSTRIES 954 USB-TO-TTL SERIAL CABLE, RASPBERRY PI" provided with the kit the pins are as follow:
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DJUHGHI/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

The red lead is 5V so if you intend to use it as power youâ€™ll need to route it to the raw input on the mini which can support up to +9V. (don't apply this if you are already supplying power) 
The black lead to GND, 
The white lead to TXD.
The green lead to RXD.
